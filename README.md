> [!NOTE]  
> Issues are not handled in this repository due to time constraints. For questions or discussions, feel free to join [AI Hispano on Discord](https://discord.gg/iahispano). If you're experiencing a technical issue, please report it on [Applio's Issues page](https://github.com/IAHispano/Applio/issues) and specify that the problem occurs via CLI.

### Installation

Ensure that you have the necessary Python packages installed by following these steps (Python 3.9 is recommended):

#### Windows

Execute the [install.bat](./install.bat) file to activate a Conda environment. Afterward, launch the application using `env/python.exe rvc_cli.py` instead of the conventional `python rvc_cli.py` command.

#### Linux

```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

### Getting Started

For detailed information and command-line options, refer to the help command:

```bash
python rvc_cli.py -h
python uvr_cli.py -h

python rvc_cli.py tts -h
python rvc_cli.py prerequisites -h
```

This command provides a clear overview of the available modes and their corresponding parameters, facilitating effective utilization of the RVC CLI, but if you need more information, you can check the [documentation](https://rvc-cli.pages.dev/).

### Examples

To do a text to speech from the command line, complete the prerequisites

```bash
python rvc_cli.py prerequisites --models True
```

Grab a model from [https://applio.org/models](https://applio.org/models) and drop it in the `rvc/models/pretraineds/pretraineds_custom/` directory, e.g.

```bash
(cd rvc/models/pretraineds/pretraineds_custom
wget https://huggingface.co/Coolwowsocoolwow/Sir_Topham_Hatt_2010s/resolve/main/Sir_Topham_Hatt_2010s_Voice_v2.zip
unzip Sir_Topham_Hatt_2010s_Voice_v2.zip
rm Sir_Topham_Hatt_2010s_Voice_v2.zip)
```

Get a short list of the standard voices available with:

```bash
venv/bin/edge-tts -l | grep en-US
```

and choose one for a test

```bash
python rvc_cli.py tts	\
	--tts_voice en-US-EmmaNeural	\
	--output_tts_path /tmp/one.mp3	\
	--output_rvc_path /tmp/two.wav	\
	--pth_path rvc/models/pretraineds/pretraineds_custom/Sir_Topham_Hatt_2010s_Voice_e220_s3740.pth	\
	--index_path rvc/models/pretraineds/pretraineds_custom/added_IVF438_Flat_nprobe_1_Sir_Topham_Hatt_2010s_Voice_v2.index	\
	--tts_file nofile	\
	--tts_text "Hello useful little engine!"
```
